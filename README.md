# What is this?
This is a plugin (tool) for the [Cheshire Cat Project](https://github.com/pieroit/cheshire-cat), allowing the Cat to retrieve real time transit data from a GTFS feed.

# Install
Download the **gtfs** folder into the **plugin** one.

# Configuration
To retrieve information, the plugin use the [Transit Land](https://www.transit.land/) API. 
- You will need an API key, a free plan is available.
- You will need also what they call a **Onestop ID**, a unique ID for a GTFS feed (ideally a feed should coincide with a city). Use their search engine to find out the right Onestop ID for you.

Write these two values into the gtfs.py file.

# Usage
Ask the cat something like "*I'm at bus stop 74637, can you tell me next buses arrivals?*".

# Output
